# Plagarism-Detector
Plagiarism has become a common issue in today’s digital world where information is easily accessible. The Plagiarism Detection Project is designed to identify copied or highly similar content in documents and help maintain originality and academic integrity. This system compares a given document with existing content to check whether the text has been copied, partially modified, or reused without proper credit.

The project works by breaking the text into smaller parts and analyzing the similarity between documents using text-matching and natural language processing techniques. Instead of only checking exact word matches, the system also detects similarities in sentence structure and meaning, making it more effective in identifying paraphrased content.

This project is especially useful for educational institutions, teachers, students, and content creators who want to ensure that their work is original. By providing a clear similarity score and highlighting matching sections, the system makes it easier to understand where plagiarism may have occurred and how serious it is.

Overall, the Plagiarism Detection Project helps promote honesty, originality, and ethical writing practices while reducing manual effort in checking documents.
